Introduction
============

The Python package 'fredist' implements methods that integrate transition-based
syntactic dependency parsing, neighborhood parse correction, and the extraction
of distributional lexical resources that can be used as features in parsing
models.

It is designed primarily for use with the French Dependency Treebank
(http://alpage.inria.fr/statgram/frdep/fr_stat_dep_parsing.html), but it can 
potentially be used with other languages and resources.

The fredist package is released with a GPL licence (see LICENCE).


Installation
============

The package relies on a number of other programs and libraries: Python, Numpy, 
LIBSVM with a Python interface, SVMLight, and PySVMLight. Software has been 
tested on Linux.

Prerequisites are:

1. Python (versions 2.6 and 2.7 have been tested)
  - Need the desired binary for Python to have the environment variable $PYTHON

2. Numpy (version 1.7.0 has been tested)

3. LIBSVM with Python interface (versions 3.11 and 3.16 have been tested)
  - Website: 'http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/'
  - Download 'libsvm-3.16.tar.gz'
  - Extract 'libsvm-3.16' to permanent location, assign it $LIBSVM
  - Run 'make' to create 'svm-train' and 'svm-predict' binaries
  - In its 'python' directory, run 'make' to create 'libsvm.so.2'
  - Add 'libsvm.so.2' library to your Python site packages directory
  - In your Python site packages directory, make a new directory 'libsvm'
  - In that directory copy the 'svm.py' and 'svmutil.py' files
  - Also in that directory, create a dummy '__init__.py' file

4. SVMLight (version 6.02 has been tested)
  - Website: 'http://svmlight.joachims.org/'
  - Download 'svm_light.tar.gz'
  - Create directory 'svmlight-6.02' in permanent location, assign it $SVMLIGHT
  - Extract archive here in this directory
  - Run 'make' to obtain 'svm_learn' and 'svm_classify' binaries

5. PySVMLight (version 0.4 has been tested)
  - Website: 'https://pypi.python.org/pypi/svmlight'
  - Download 'svmlight-0.4.tar.gz'
  - Extract 'svmlight-0.4' to any location
  - Follow README to install 'svmlight.so' library to your Python site packages


You can then install fredist by running the usual sequence of commands from the
top-level directory:

$> python setup.py install

The easiest way to use fredist is to run the module files as scripts, so you
should set the environment variable $FREDIST to the location in the Python
site-packages where fredist has been installed. 

A simple example of training and testing a parsing model is provided in the 
'example' directory of this distribution.
