Introduction
============

The Python package 'fredist' implements methods that integrate transition-based
syntactic dependency parsing, neighborhood parse correction, and the extraction
of distributional lexical resources that can be used as features in parsing
models.

It is designed primarily for use with the French Dependency Treebank
(http://alpage.inria.fr/statgram/frdep/fr_stat_dep_parsing.html), but it can 
potentially be used with other languages and resources.

The fredist package is released with a GPL licence (see LICENCE).


Installation
============

The package relies on a number of other programs and libraries: Python, Numpy, 
LIBSVM with a Python interface, SVMLight, and PySVMLight. Software has been 
tested on Linux.

Prerequisites are:

1. Python (versions 2.6 and 2.7 have been tested)
  - Need the desired binary for Python to have the environment variable $PYTHON

2. Numpy (version 1.7.0 has been tested)

3. LIBSVM with Python interface (versions 3.11 and 3.16 have been tested)
  - Website is 'http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/'
  - Download 'libsvm-3.16.tar.gz'
  - Extract 'libsvm-3.16' to permanent location, assign it $LIBSVM
  - Run 'make' to create 'svm-train' and 'svm-predict' binaries
  - In its 'python' directory, run 'make' to create 'libsvm.so.2'
  - Add 'libsvm.so.2' library to your Python site packages directory
  - In your Python site packages directory, make a new directory 'libsvm'
  - In that directory copy the 'svm.py' and 'svmutil.py' files
  - Also in that directory, create a dummy '__init__.py' file

4. SVMLight (version 6.02 has been tested)
  - Website is 'http://svmlight.joachims.org/'
  - Download 'svm_light.tar.gz'
  - Create directory 'svmlight-6.02' in parmenent location, assign it $SVMLIGHT
  - Extract archive here in this directory
  - Run 'make' to obtain 'svm_learn' and 'svm_classify' binaries

5. PySVMLight (version 0.4 has been tested)
  - Website is 'https://pypi.python.org/pypi/svmlight'
  - Download 'svmlight-0.4.tar.gz'
  - Extract 'svmlight-0.4' to any location
  - Follow README to install 'svmlight.so' library to your Python site packages


You can install fredist by running the usual sequence of commands from the
top-level directory:

$> python setup.py install

* NOTE * The release includes a 'data' directory containing useful default 
feature templates (as Python files) as well as a text file containing accepted 
preposition lemmas for the extraction of PP-attachment preference scores. The
user needs to manually set, in dtbutils.py, the variable DATADIR to the 
appropriate location.


Version History
===============

* Version 2.0 *
- Addition of transition-based dependency parsing and neighborhood parse 
correction algorithms
-  Methods for creating lexical generalization and PP-attachment resources 
that can be integrated as features into parsing models.

* Version 1.0 *
- Creation of a working Python package for the construction of distributional 
thesauri from text corpora.
